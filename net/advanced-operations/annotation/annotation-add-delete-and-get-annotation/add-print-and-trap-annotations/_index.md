# Add Print and Trap Annotations

A Printer’s Mark Annotation represents a graphic symbol or text added to a page to assist production. Such as a registration target, color bar, or cut mark, that may be added to a page to assist production personnel in identifying components of a multiple-plate job and maintaining consistent output during production. 

A Trap network annotation may be used to define the trapping characteristics for a page of a PDF document.

Trapping is the process of adding marks to a page along color boundaries to avoid unwanted visual artifacts resulting from misregistration of colorants when the page is printed.
A page shall have no more than one trap network annotation, whose Subtype entry has the value TrapNet and which shall always be the last element in the page object’s Annots array
