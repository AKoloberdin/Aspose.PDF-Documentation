## What is a PDF File?

PDF stands for portable document format. The PDF file format was created by Adobe in 1990 and is one of the most common formats used today. A PDF file is a read-only document that preserves its original layout, preventing modification but allowing users to easily share and print the file.

Using a PDF has two benefits which present a solution to these obstacles. First, someone who receives a PDF file can open it on any program. In other words, they don’t need to have the app used to create the file in order to view it.

These advantages make PDFs more shareable than other file formats and ensure that viewers see the document as intended
