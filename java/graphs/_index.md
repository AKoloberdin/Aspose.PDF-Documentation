## What is Graph

Adding graphs to PDF documents is a very common task for developers while working with Adobe Acrobat Writer or other PDF processing applications. There are many types of graphs that can be used in PDF applications.
[Aspose.PDF for .NET](/pdf/net/) also supports adding graphs to PDF documents. For this purpose, the Graph class is provided. Graph is a paragraph level element and it can be added to the Paragraphs collection in a Page instance. A Graph instance contains a collection of Shapes.

The following types of shapes are supported by the [Graph](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.drawing/graph) class:

- [Arc](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.drawing/arc)
- [Circle](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.drawing/circle)
- [Curve](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.drawing/curve)
- [Line](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.drawing/line)
- [Rectangle](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.drawing/rectangle)
- [Ellipse](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf.drawing/ellipse)

The above details are also depicted in the figures below:
