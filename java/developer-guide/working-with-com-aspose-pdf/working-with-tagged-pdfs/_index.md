Aspose.PDF provides functionality to create PDF documents which are compatible with PDF/UA Standard (also known as "Section 508" or "WCAG Standard") and also to check compatibility with these standards. These standards describe requirements for document contents to make it more friendly and useful for people with disabilities and also for users with highly limited devices. When you make your PDF documents accessible or create Tagged PDFs, it means adding tags, bookmarks, alt text, and other information that makes the files readable and navigable to users who are visually or mobility impaired. Using Aspose.PDF, it is now achievable to create valid, accessible PDF documents. Following section shows how to add tagged content to create Tagged PDF.
