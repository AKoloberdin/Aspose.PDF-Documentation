**Advanced Operations** is a section about how to deals with existing PDF files programatically, be they documents created with Aspose.PDF as discussed in [Basic Operations](/pdf/php-java/basic-operations), or PDFs created with Adobe Acrobat, Google Docs, Microsoft Office, Open Office or any other PDF producer.

You'll learn different ways to:

- [Working with Forms](/pdf/php-java/working-with-forms/) - deal with interact PDF documents, add formfields, extract data.
