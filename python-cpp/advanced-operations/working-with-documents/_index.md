PDF stands for the Portable Document Format, used to display documents in an electronic form independent of the software, hardware, or operating system they are viewed on.

The PDF is an open standard, maintained by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) today.

The original goal was to preserve and protect the content and layout of a document - no matter what platform or computer program it is viewed on. This is why PDFs are hard to edit and sometimes even extracting information from them is a challenge.

But **Aspose.PDF for Python** can help you cope with most of the tasks that arise when working with a PDF document.

You are able to do the following:

- [Optimize PDF](/pdf/cpp/optimize-pdf/) - optimize page content, optimize file size, remove unused objects, compress all images for successful document optimization.
- [Merge PDF](/pdf/cpp/merge-pdf-documents/) - merge multiple PDF files into a single PDF document using Python.
- [Split PDF](/pdf/cpp/split-document/) - split PDF pages into individual PDF files in your Python applications.
