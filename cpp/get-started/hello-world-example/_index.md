A "Hello World" example is traditionally used to introduce features of a programming language or software with a simple use case.

Aspose.PDF for .NET is a feature rich PDF API that allows the developers to embed PDF document creation, manipulation & conversion capabilities in their .NET applications. It supports working with many popular file formats including PDF, XFA, TXT, HTML, PCL, XML, XPS, EPUB, TEX and image file formats. In this article, we are creating a PDF document containing text "Hello World!". After installing Aspose.PDF for .NET in your environment, you can execute below code sample to see how Aspose.PDF API works.

Below code snippet follows these steps:

1. Instantiate a [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document) object
1. Add a [Page](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.page) to document object
1. Create a [TextFragment](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.text.text_fragment) object
1. Add TextFragment to [Paragraphs](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.paragraphs) collection of the page
1. [Save](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/class/aspose.pdf.document#a0184df207563187be7df37b8dbe443f6) resultant PDF document

Following code snippet is a Hello World program to exhibit working of Aspose.PDF for .NET API.

```cpp
void ExampleSimple()
{
    // Buffer to hold combined path.
    String outputFileName;

    // String for path name.
    String _dataDir("C:\\Samples\\");

    // String for file name.
    String filename("HelloWorld_out.pdf");

    auto document = MakeObject<Document>();
    auto page = document->get_Pages()->Add();

    // Add text to new page
    auto text = MakeObject<TextFragment>(u"Hello world!");

    auto paragraphs = page->get_Paragraphs();
    paragraphs->Add(text);

    // Save updated PDF
    outputFileName = _dataDir + filename;

    document->Save(outputFileName);
}
```
