# Add Widget Annotation

Interactive forms  use widget annotations to represent the appearance of fields and to manage user interactions.
We use this form elements that add to a PDF to make it easier to enter, submit information or perform some other user interactions.

A field can have zero or more widgets attached to it: a TextField, ListBox, ComboBox, and CheckBox usually have exactly one, while the RadioGroup has multiple widgets, one for each radio button.

In some cases, you may want a field to appear on more than one page, repeating the same value. In that case, fields that normally have just one widget may have multiple widgets attached. Someone filling out the form may use any of those widgets to update the field's value, and this is reflected in all the other widgets as well.
